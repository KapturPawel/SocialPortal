##Social portal

Project that I am working on since march 2018. It is social portal, that has functionalities like registering user, logging on account, sending invitations to friends, adding friends, sending private messages, adding statuses on profiles and comments in statuses. Project is based on MVC pattern. It's using spring boot. Hibernate is used for connecting with mySQL database. It's has some Javascript code, mainly for targeting right elements on site and doing right actions.
